 * TINY KINGDOM — game.js
 * The most addictive browser strategy game possible.
 * Core addiction loops:
 * 1. Daily streak system
 * 2. Cliffhanger events (consequences revealed next session)
 * 3. Permanent consequences (real stakes)
 * 4. Visual kingdom growth (satisfying progress)
 * 5. Achievement dopamine hits
 * 6. Near-miss mechanics (almost lost!)
